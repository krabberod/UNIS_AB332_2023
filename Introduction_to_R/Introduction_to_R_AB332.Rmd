This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook.  Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. For more information see the book [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).

When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

Example:
```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I* (macOS) or *Ctrl+Alt+I* (Windows).

```{r}

```


When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Basic operations

```{r}
6+6 # sums two numbers. The answer will appear underneath:
6-6
6*6
6/6
log(6)
log2(6)
log10(6)
log(6,10)
log(6,3)
6^6
sin(pi/2)
cos(pi/2)
# ETC
```

The hashtag `#` can be used inside chunks for commenting.

Define a variable with `<-`
You can also use an equal sign, but this is not recommended. The "arrow" makes the code easier to read.
```{r}
mysum <- 6+6 #sum two integers and assign it to a variable
mysum = 6+6 #same as above
mysum #check variable content by executing "mysum"

```

Check the list of variables defined so far
```{r}
ls()
```

The same variables are also listed in the *Environment* panel of RStudio

Remove a variable:
```{r}
rm(mysum)
rm(list=ls()) # NB will remove all variables!
```

# Objects or data structures: Vectors, Lists, Matrices, Arrays, Factors, Data frames
Basic datatypes on which R objects are built

**Numeric:** numbers with decimals
```{r}
mynumber<-66.6
print(mynumber)
class(mynumber) # check the type

#Integer: numbers with no decimals
mynumber.int<-as.integer(mynumber)
class(mynumber.int)
mynumber.int
```


**Character**: can be a letter or a combination of letters enclosed by quotes
```{r}
mychar<-"bioinfo course"
mychar
class(mychar)
```

**Logical**: a variable that can be TRUE or FALSE (boolean)
```{r}
im.true<-TRUE
im.true
class(im.true)
```

**Factor**: used to refer to a qualitative relationship.
to generate a factor, we'll use a vector defined with the function ```c()```

```{r}
myfactor<-factor(c("good", "bad", "ugly", "good","good","bad", "ugly"))
myfactor
class(myfactor)
levels(myfactor) # this can be used to check the levels of a factor
nlevels(myfactor)
class(levels(myfactor))

```

**Lists**
It can contain elements of various data types (e.g.vectors,functions,matrices,another list)
Example with three different data types in one list
```{r}
list1<-c(1:5) # integer vector
list2<-factor(1:5) # factor vector
list3<-letters[1:5]
grouped.lists<-list(list1,list2,list3)
grouped.lists
```

Accessing elements of a list
```{r}
grouped.lists[[1]] # accessing the first vector
grouped.lists[[3]][4] # accessing the 5th element from the third vector
```
Ungroup the list
```{r}
ungrouped.list<-unlist(grouped.lists)
class(ungrouped.list)  # NB: the list becomes a character datatype. WHY?
length(ungrouped.list)
length(grouped.lists)
```

**Vectors**
Objects that are used to store values or other information of the same data type
They are created with the function "c()" that will generate a 1D array
```{r}
species<-c(123,434,655,877,986) # we create a numeric vector
class(species)
length(species) # number of elements in the vector
species[5] # accessing the fifth element in the vector
species[1:3]
sum(species) # sum the values in the vector
```
```{r}
species.names<-c("dog","lion","human","pig","cow") # we create a character vector
class(species.names)
```
Create a sequence of numbers:
```{r}
seq.num<-c(3:10)
seq.num
```

```{r}
seq.num.by2<-seq(1,100, 3)
```

we can access the 5th to the 10th element using the ```:```
```{r}
seq.num.by2[5:10]
```

**Matrix**  
Like a vector, a matrix stores information of the same data type, but it has 2 dimensions.

syntax for generating a matrix:  
`mymatrix <- matrix(vector, nrow=r, ncol=c, byrow=FALSE, dimnames=list(char_vector_rownames, char_vector_colnames))```  

 `byrow=F`  indicates that the matrix should be filled by columns
```{r}
mymatrix <- matrix(seq(1:100), nrow=10, ncol=10, byrow=FALSE, dimnames=list(c(1:10), letters[1:10]))
mymatrix
```

A matrix with random numbers:
```{r}
mymatrix.rand <- matrix(sample (seq(1:100),100), nrow=10, ncol=10, byrow=FALSE, dimnames=list(c(1:10), letters[1:10]))
mymatrix.rand
```


```{r}
mymatrix[3:6,1:3] # We select what sections of the matrix we want to look at
```

**Dataframes** are more general than a matrix and can contain different data types.  
Variables or features are in columns, while observations are in rows.  
=>NB: this is one of the most common objects in metabarcoding analyses<=
Generated with the `data.frame()` function
```{r}
my.data.frame<-data.frame(
  Name=c("Game of Thrones","MrRobot","WestWorld"),
  Budget=c(344,59,122),
  Seasons=c(8,4,3),
  Audience=c(300,14,80),
  Actors=c(221,56, 90)
)
print(my.data.frame)
```

```{r}
row.names(my.data.frame)<-my.data.frame[,1] # Assign to the row names the names in the first column
my.data.frame<-my.data.frame[,-1] # Remove the fisrt column
my.data.frame # By clicking this object in the "Environment" panel on the right, you'll see a window with the dataframe
```

```{r}
class(my.data.frame)
ncol(my.data.frame) # Number of columns
nrow(my.data.frame) # Number of rows
colnames(my.data.frame) # Column names
rownames(my.data.frame) # Name of rows
colSums(my.data.frame) # Sum values in columns
rowSums(my.data.frame) # We sum the values, even if they make no sense in the example
rbind(my.data.frame,my.data.frame) #  appends dataframes one below the other (column names identical)
cbind(my.data.frame,my.data.frame) # appends dataframes one next to the other (row names identical)
head(my.data.frame, 2) # Useful to have a look to the beginning of the dataframe (specially useful in big tables)
my.data.frame[1:2,2:4] # Useful to look at specific sections of the dataframe
```


Let's generate a dataframe with different data types
```{r}
my.data.frame.2<-data.frame(
  Name=c("Game of Thrones","MrRobot","WestWorld", "Chernobyl"),
  Rating=c("Excellent","Very Good","Excellent", "Very Good"),
  Audience.Restriction=c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE, FALSE)
)
my.data.frame.2
```
Rename the row names
```{r}

row.names(my.data.frame.2)<-my.data.frame.2[,1]
my.data.frame.2
my.data.frame.2<-my.data.frame.2[,-1] # Remove redundant column 1
my.data.frame.2
str(my.data.frame.2) # Let's look at the data types within this dataframe
```

# Variables in this case are characters and logical (TRUE/FALSE)

#Merge two dataframes based in a pattern
# We will use the series names to merge these dataframes as this is what they have in common
```{r}
data.frame.large<-merge(my.data.frame, my.data.frame.2, by="row.names") # "by" indicates the column used for merging
```


#Useful commands to work with tables or dataframes
```{r}
getwd() # get working directory
```
You can change the working directory:
```{r}
#setwd("path/to/my/directory") # set working directory
```

```{#r}
#my.table<-read.table(file="table.tsv", sep="\t", header=T) # read table; several other options available
dim(my.table) # Table dimensions
nrow(my.table) # Number of rows
ncol(my.table) # Number of columns
colnames(my.table) # Name of columns
rownames(my.table) # Name of rows
colSums(my.table) # Sum of numeric values in columns
rowSums(my.table) # Sum of numeric values in rows
head(my.table) # See table header
t(my.table) # Transpose table
```

Table subsetting
Format:  `my.table[row, column]`

```{#r}
my.table[1,2] #Get value from row 1, column 2
my.table[1,]  #Get values from row 1 across all columns
my.table$column.name<-NULL #Remove column
my.table[-5,-2] # Remove row 5 and column 2
my.table[-(5:10),] # Remove rows 5 to 10, keep all columns
my.table[,-(which(colSums(my.table)==0))] # Remove columns that sum 0
```

# Installing packages
R has a large repository of packages for different applications
```{#r}
install.packages("vegan") # Installs the community ecology package Vegan with hundreds of functions
library("vegan") # load Vegan
```

#Plotting
```{r}
data("mtcars") # We load a dataset that comes with R
```
The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects
of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models).

>For plotting the package ggplot2 is very becomming increasingly popular: It is already included in the package **tidyverse**, but can also be installed by itself:

```{r}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
```

# Some tips and hits
Use "?" before any function to get the help page.
```{r}
?sum
```

If you don't know where a function is from use "??":
```{r}
??rarefy
```
