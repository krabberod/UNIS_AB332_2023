### Under construction

We will use R (version 4.0.5 or later) and Rstudio (version 1.4.1 or later) in this course.

Everybody should download Rstudio  (https://www.rstudio.com/) and install R (https://www.r-project.org/) before the course starts and the [required packages](Install_required_packages.R).

It is also preferable that you have all packages installed before the course starts (see below or [Install_required_packages.R](Install_required_packages.R). For those of you having trouble with installing the packages, we will try to find some time during the first computer lab to get everybody up and running.

**NB Some packages requires administrator access to be installed. If you are working on a computer administered by somebody else (for instance owned by a University) you might have to ask your IT department to either grant you temporary admin rights or help you install the packages**  
**NB Setting the working directory to a path in One Drive can result in errors and is adviced against, if you have not done it before**

Content of [required packages](Install_required_packages.R):

```R
# AB332_2021
# Please make sure that you have the required R packages installed.
# You can get a list of the package already installed on your computer by executing

installed.packages()

# in R alternatively you can just run the installation for each package
# to make sure that you have the latest version.
# Run these installation commands line-by-line in R (or Rstudio)
# and answer "yes" if you are asked to update any previously installed pakages:
# If you are asked if you want to compile from source it is usually easiest to answer "no"
